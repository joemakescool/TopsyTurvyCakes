Why is there a Project folder needed to run the file? I got a null return with my data when I didn't have it.
The link that the html view page has is with the var recipes=new RecipesService.GetAll(). This is like the controller. But the html razor page on 
AddRecipe has a razor model. It linked itself via the same way but on the models page, not on the html page. 
Asp-page
asp-for
asp-action
asp-route-id, all of the asp are tag helpers.
Hold ctrl down and you can click on a class or a function to see where it is.
Where does the contructor get called in the AddEditRecipe.cshtml.cs?
